       <h1>Places I would like to visit</h1>
       <p>I have often wondered how exhilarating it would be to visit every single continent in the world and go to at least 10 nations in each. While that seems like a goal out of reach right now considering the financial implication of doing so, I simply just enjoy traveling. Today, I just want to share with you a few of my dream vacation destinations.</p>
        <p>Why do I enjoy traveling you may ask? Well, I want to travel the world because I like to explore new cultures, understand beliefs that that people hold on to, explore nature’s wonders and of course, enjoy the local food available in that vicinity. I believe each city has a story to tell and I would like to start learning these stories by exploring some of the most visited cities of the world with rich culture, architecture and personality. On that note, I would like to share a few of the places I would like to visit in the nearest future.
       </p>
        <h2>Rome</h2>
        <p>This is a destination that most speak highly of with regards to its incredible art and architecture, tasty food, rich historical sites, and beautiful coastlines. I am interested at present in just three of its mind-blowing historical destinations: The Pantheon, Trevi Fountain and Sistine Chapel.</p>
            <h3>Trevi Fountain:</h3>
            <img src = "C:\Users\bidai\desktop\lc101\html-me-something\Images\trevi fountain.jpeg" alt = "The magnificient Trevi Fountain" style="height:300px;widows: 300px;">
            <p>Trevi fountain displays one of the powerful artistic features of Rome. The fountain is a baroque design of a mythological character: The god of the sea, Oceanus as it emerges from the pool, flanked by his trusty Tritons.</p>
            <img src = "C:\Users\bidai\desktop\lc101\html-me-something\Images\trevi fountain3.jpg" alt = "Oceanus in the Trevi Fountain" style="height:300px;widows: 300px;">
            <p>Roman lore suggests that, throwing one, two or three coins into the Trevi, with your right hand over your left shoulder ensures you'll return to Rome; you'll fall in love with an attractive Roman; and you'll marry that same Roman. 
                When I visit, I hopefully will test out this myth.</p>

                <h3>The Pantheon</h3>
                <img src = "C:\Users\bidai\desktop\lc101\html-me-something\Images\Pantheon4.jpg" alt = "The Pantheon" style="height:300px;">

                <p>Unlike the artistic Trevi fountain exemplifies Rome’s architecture. The Pantheon is a former Roman temple and a present-day church, is known for its perfect proportions. It was raised in A.D. 120 and currently is the funeral site for prominent people such as; Raphael the artist, as well as Italian kings Victor Emmanuel II and Umberto I.</p>

        <h2>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</h2>
        <p>Dubai in recent years has been featured for its iconic skylines and luxury yet ultramodern buildings. A city known for its culture and shopping experience. I would love to explore this “luxurious shopping city”, hopefully staying at either one of the sky rise hotels or the beach resorts.</p>
        <img src = "C:\Users\bidai\desktop\lc101\html-me-something\Images\burj3.jpg" alt = "Burj Khalifa image from suzzstravels" style="height:350px;width: 400px;">

        <p>I would like to visit The Burj Khalifa which currently is considered the world’s tallest freestanding building. It has 160 stories and an observation deck at the very top! The thought of that is just so exhilarating! Learn more about this iconic architectural piece at <a href="https://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/stories/">https://www.burjkhalifa.ae/en/stories/</a></p>
